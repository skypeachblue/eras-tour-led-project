# The Eras Tour - LED Project

My goal here was to create an LED strip which will light up in sync with the Pixmob LED bracelets, controlled by the IR senders inside the stadium.

The IR commands in this project are based on the [pixmob-ir-reverse-engineering repo](https://github.com/danielweidman/pixmob-ir-reverse-engineering),
including the file in [this issue](https://github.com/danielweidman/pixmob-ir-reverse-engineering/issues/13).
